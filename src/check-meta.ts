			"Audits Worker configuration and code together: wrangler config hygiene (compatibility date age, main entry), secrets accidentally committed in [vars], declared bindings (D1/KV/R2/DO/vars) that the code never uses, code touching env.* bindings that are not declared, cron triggers without a scheduled() handler, and node: imports without the nodejs_compat flag.",
		risk: "A stale compatibility date silently opts you out of runtime fixes. Secrets in [vars] end up in git and in every deploy log. Undeclared bindings crash only at runtime in production; unused ones mask dead config. Cron triggers without a handler fail silently forever.",
		recommendation:
			"Keep compatibility_date within a year. Move secrets to `wrangler secret put`. Delete unused bindings; declare every binding the code touches. Add a scheduled() handler for every cron. Add nodejs_compat when importing node: builtins.",
